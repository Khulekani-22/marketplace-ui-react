## 🔧 Technical Details

### Authentication Methods Documented:
1. **Firebase Authentication** (Primary)
   - Bearer token in Authorization header
   - Used for user-facing applications

2. **JWT Authentication** (Optional)
   - Custom JWT tokens
   - For internal services

3. **API Keys** (Planned for Phase 2)
   - For machine-to-machine communication
   - Will support tiered access

### Response Formats:
- **Success:** Consistent JSON with status, data, pagination
- **Errors:** Standardized error objects with codes
- **Pagination:** Standard page/pageSize/total format

### Rate Limits (Current):
- Public: 100 req/hour
- Authenticated: 1000 req/hour
- Admin: 5000 req/hour
