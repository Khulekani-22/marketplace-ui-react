# ✅ Services API Improved - GET by ID Support Added

## 🎯 What Was Improved

Added **RESTful GET by ID endpoint** for services to align with standard API patterns and match your Firestore data structure.

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **New Route Added** - `backend/routes/services.js`

Added `GET /api/data/services/:id` endpoint:

```javascript
/**
 * GET /api/data/services/:id
 * Get a single service by ID
 * Public endpoint - no authentication required
 */
router.get("/:id", async (req, res) => {
  // Tries Firestore first, falls back to cache
  // Returns 404 if service not found
  // Respects tenant scoping
});
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Fetches single service by ID
- ✅ Tries Firestore first for performance
- ✅ Falls back to cached data if Firestore fails
- ✅ Respects tenant scoping (public tenant visibility)
- ✅ Returns proper error responses (400, 404, 500)
- ✅ No authentication required (public endpoint)

### 2. **New Method Added** - `backend/utils/firestoreDataStore.js`

Added `getServiceById()` method:

```javascript
/**
 * Get a single service by ID
 * @param {string} serviceId - The service ID to fetch
 * @returns {Promise<Object|null>} The service object or null if not found
 */
async getServiceById(serviceId) {
  // Fetches from Firestore services collection
  // Serializes Firestore timestamps
  // Returns null if not found
}
```

## 🧪 Test It in Postman

### Test 1: Get Specific Service
```
GET http://localhost:5055/api/data/services/1
Headers:
  X-API-Key: d5ac8c153592bf1e7cbc28f451edb71245cf0e90229ce202bed503e98a610a08
```

**Expected:** 200 OK with single service object

### Test 2: Get Another Service
```
GET http://localhost:5055/api/data/services/X6rF03vck1HIXfg4hbjy
Headers:
  X-API-Key: {{api_key}}
```

**Expected:** 200 OK with "Business plan generator" service

### Test 3: Non-existent Service
```
GET http://localhost:5055/api/data/services/nonexistent-id
Headers:
  X-API-Key: {{api_key}}
```

**Expected:** 404 Not Found
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Service not found",
  "code": "SERVICE_NOT_FOUND"
}
```

### Test 4: Missing ID
```
GET http://localhost:5055/api/data/services/
Headers:
  X-API-Key: {{api_key}}
```

**Expected:** Returns all services (matches the list endpoint)

## 📊 Performance Optimization

The endpoint implements a **two-tier strategy**:

1. **Primary: Firestore Direct Lookup** (Fast!)
   - Direct document fetch by ID
   - No query overhead
   - Millisecond response time

2. **Fallback: Cached Data** (Reliable!)
   - Uses in-memory cache
   - Returns data even if Firestore is down
   - Ensures high availability

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Public Access (No Auth Required)
```
GET /api/data/services/1
(No authentication needed)
```

### With API Key (Tracked & Rate Limited)
```
GET /api/data/services/1
Headers:
  X-API-Key: your-api-key
```
- Request is tracked
- Rate limits apply
- Usage counted

### With Firebase Token (User Context)
```
GET /api/data/services/1
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer your-firebase-token
```
- User context available
- Tenant-aware filtering

## 🎯 Error Responses

### 400 Bad Request
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Service ID is required"
}
```

### 404 Not Found
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Service not found",
  "code": "SERVICE_NOT_FOUND"
}
```

### 500 Internal Server Error
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Failed to fetch service",
  "error": "Firestore connection timeout"
}
```

## 🌐 Tenant Scoping

The endpoint respects tenant boundaries:

- **Public tenant** services are visible to all
- **Other tenants** only see their own services
- Cross-tenant access blocked automatically

Example:
```javascript
// Public service - visible to everyone
{
  "id": "1",
  "tenantId": "public",
  "title": "Logo Design"
}

// Vendor service - only visible to vendor tenant
{
  "id": "vendor-123",
  "tenantId": "vendor",
  "title": "Private Service"
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Update Postman Collection
Add the new endpoint to your collection:
```
GET {{base_url}}/api/data/services/{{service_id}}
```

### 2. Test Different Services
```bash
# Test with various IDs from your data
curl http://localhost:5055/api/data/services/1
curl http://localhost:5055/api/data/services/X6rF03vck1HIXfg4hbjy
curl http://localhost:5055/api/data/services/uTgKXEWI2SYqoK1DeEYU
```

### 3. Add to Frontend
```javascript
// Before (filtering client-side)
const services = await fetch('/api/data/services');
const service = services.items.find(s => s.id === serviceId);

// After (direct fetch)
const service = await fetch(`/api/data/services/${serviceId}`);
```

### 4. Monitor Performance
Check `/api/monitoring/stats` to see:
- How often the endpoint is used
- Average response times
- Cache hit rates
