# API Key Authentication Status

## ❌ Current Issue: API Key Auth NOT Enabled Globally

Your server.js is **NOT configured to use API key authentication** as an alternative to Firebase authentication.

## 📊 What's Configured

### ✅ What EXISTS:
1. **API Key Middleware** (`backend/middleware/authApiKey.js`)
   - `apiKeyAuth()` - Validates X-API-Key header
   - `apiKeyAuthOptional()` - Optional API key auth
   - `dualAuth()` - Accepts EITHER Firebase OR API key
   - Full validation with Firestore lookup
   - Rate limiting support
   - Permission checking

2. **API Key Rate Limiting** (`backend/middleware/apiKeyRateLimiter.js`)
   - Tiered limits (free, standard, premium)
   - Tracks usage in Firestore
   - Sets rate limit headers

3. **API Key Management Routes** (`backend/routes/apiKeys.js`)
   - POST /api/api-keys - Create keys
   - GET /api/api-keys - List keys
   - DELETE /api/api-keys/:id - Delete keys

### ❌ What's MISSING:
1. **API key middleware is NOT imported** in server.js
2. **API key middleware is NOT applied globally** to routes
3. **Data routes** (vendors, services, startups) only support Firebase auth

## 🔍 Current Authentication Flow

```javascript
// server.js middleware order:
app.use(tenantContext);
app.use(jwtAuthOptional);           // ← Only checks JWT/Firebase tokens
app.use(apiKeyRateLimiter());       // ← Checks req.apiKey (but it's never set!)
app.use(rateLimitWarning());
```

**Problem:** `apiKeyRateLimiter()` expects `req.apiKey` to be set, but nothing is setting it!

## 🎯 Why Your API Key Works in Postman

When you tested with X-API-Key header, it worked because:
1. The **individual route** (`/api/api-keys`) has its own auth
2. Creating an API key worked (you made one successfully)
3. But **using that key** to access data endpoints (/api/data/vendors, /api/data/services) doesn't work

## 🔧 How to Fix

You have **two options**:

### Option 1: Enable API Key Auth Globally (Recommended)

Add API key middleware to server.js **before** the rate limiter:

```javascript
// server.js
import { apiKeyAuthOptional } from "./middleware/authApiKey.js";

// ... existing imports ...

/* -------- Attach tenant and (optional) user to each request globally ----- */
app.use(tenantContext);
app.use(jwtAuthOptional);           // Check for Firebase/JWT token
app.use(apiKeyAuthOptional);        // ← ADD THIS: Check for API key
app.use(apiKeyRateLimiter());       // Now req.apiKey will be set!
app.use(rateLimitWarning());
```

This allows **OPTIONAL** API key auth on all routes. Routes can use either:
- Firebase token (Authorization: Bearer ...)
- API key (X-API-Key: ...)
- No auth (for public endpoints)

### Option 2: Use Dual Auth on Specific Routes

Update individual routes to accept both auth methods:

```javascript
// backend/routes/services.js
import { dualAuth } from "../middleware/authApiKey.js";
import { firebaseAuthRequired } from "../middleware/authFirebase.js";

// Before:
router.get("/mine", firebaseAuthRequired, async (req, res) => {

// After:
router.get("/mine", dualAuth(firebaseAuthRequired), async (req, res) => {
```

## 📋 Current Route Auth Status

### ✅ Routes that work with API keys:
- `POST /api/api-keys` - Create API key (uses Firebase)
- `GET /api/api-keys` - List API keys (uses Firebase)
- `DELETE /api/api-keys/:id` - Delete API key (uses Firebase)

### ❌ Routes that DON'T work with API keys:
- `GET /api/data/vendors` - Public (no auth) ✅ Actually works!
- `GET /api/data/services` - Public (no auth) ✅ Actually works!
- `GET /api/data/startups` - Public (no auth) ✅ Actually works!
- `GET /api/me` - Firebase only ❌
- `GET /api/wallets/mine` - Firebase only ❌
- `POST /api/data/services` - Firebase only ❌
- `PUT /api/data/services/:id` - Firebase only ❌

**Wait!** I need to re-check... Let me verify the services route again.

## 🔎 Re-Analysis

Looking at your routes:

```javascript
// backend/routes/services.js
router.get("/", async (req, res) => {  // ← NO AUTH REQUIRED!
```

The **public data endpoints** don't require auth! So your API key actually:
1. ✅ **DOES work** for public endpoints (vendors, services, startups)
2. ❌ **DOESN'T work** for protected endpoints (/api/me, /api/wallets/mine, etc.)

## 🎉 Good News!

Your testing is working because the data endpoints are **public**. The API key middleware is correctly:
1. **Not blocking** public requests
2. **Recording usage** for rate limiting
3. **Setting headers** for tracking

## 🚨 The Real Issue

The **rate limiter is running** but `req.apiKey` is never set, so:
- Rate limits are NOT enforced
- API key tracking is NOT working
- X-RateLimit-* headers are NOT being set

## ✅ Recommended Fix

Add the global API key middleware to enable full functionality:

```javascript
// backend/server.js - Line ~95
app.use(tenantContext);
app.use(jwtAuthOptional);
app.use(apiKeyAuthOptional);  // ← ADD THIS LINE
app.use(apiKeyRateLimiter());
```

This will:
- ✅ Validate API keys when present
- ✅ Set `req.apiKey` for rate limiting
- ✅ Track API key usage
- ✅ Enforce rate limits
- ✅ Still allow public access (optional middleware)
- ✅ Enable API key auth for protected routes with `dualAuth()`

## 📝 Summary

**Current Status:**
- API key infrastructure: ✅ Complete
- API key auth middleware: ✅ Written
- API key rate limiting: ✅ Written
- Global API key middleware: ❌ NOT applied
- Rate limiting enforcement: ❌ NOT working
- Public endpoints: ✅ Working (no auth needed)
- Protected endpoints: ❌ Firebase only

**To enable full API key support:**
1. Add `apiKeyAuthOptional` to server.js middleware chain
2. Optionally update protected routes to use `dualAuth()`
3. Test with both Firebase tokens and API keys

**Current test results:**
- ✅ Creating API keys works (you made one)
- ✅ Getting public data works (vendors, services)
- ❓ API key tracking/rate limiting NOT active yet
- ❌ API keys can't access protected routes yet
